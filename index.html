          <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
          <p>Apart from my passion for tech, I also enjoy running, biking, longboarding, and playing table-tennis.</p>
          <p class="mb-0">In my free time, I also enjoy a variety of TV shows. The best of them is Silicon Valley (which further inspired
            my interest in the tech industry), Suits, and The Office. Since the age of 17, I've enjoyed studying philosophy,
            and am currently taking a first-year philosophy class and reading some books on post-modernism.
